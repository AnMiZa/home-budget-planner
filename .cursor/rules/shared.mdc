# AI Rules for Home Budget Planner

Home Budget Planner is a web application designed with a “mobile-first” approach, aimed at simplifying the process of planning and tracking monthly household expenses. The application allows users to add up the monthly income of all household members, create a budget by allocating funds to predefined expense categories, and then monitor the implementation of this plan on an ongoing basis.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
