## Project description

Home Budget Planner is a web application designed with a “mobile-first” approach to simplify the planning and tracking of monthly household expenses. It enables users to sum up the monthly income of all household members, create a budget by allocating funds to self-defined expense categories, and monitor the execution of this plan on an ongoing basis. The key principles of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version are simplicity, an intuitive interface, and a focus on core functionalities that effectively address the challenge of managing home finances.
